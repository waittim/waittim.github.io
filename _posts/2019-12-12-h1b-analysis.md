# H1B
The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows companies in the US to hire graduate-level workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields.

### Requirements
1. A bachelor's degree.
2. Job offer from a company within the United States for a specialty position that matches your degree.

### Why is H1B Popular?
1. For a company in the US, applying for H1B is generally quicker than applying for a US Green Card, so it is popular when they want to bring in an employee for a longer period.
2. H1B is open to nationals and citizens of any country, as opposed to other visa types that are only open to people with certain countries of citizenship.
3. H1B allows holders to stay for three years initially and can be easily extended to three more years after the first term.
4. H1B allows holders to move their status from one company to another and also allows its holders to work part-time and work for multiple employers at the same time.
5. The main benefit of H1B that attracts a large volume of applicants is the fact that it is a dual intent visa. This means that it allows its holders to seek permanent residency while under the H1B nonimmigrant status.

### Caveats
Despite having a lot of advantages, applying for the H1B comes with its own set of caveats or disadvantages.

1. The biggest drawback of H1B is the fact that there is a limit on the number of petitions that are approved each year. Because of the large number of petitions each year, the USCIS has chosen to have all petitions entered into a lottery. Through this an annual general cap of 65,000 in first, and then run the remaining in the masterâ€™s-and-above 20,000 categories.
This means there is a strong likelihood that for any given year, your petition will not be selected. Once rejected, you will have to wait another year to submit another petition.
2. Because of its lottery, the deadlines for the H1B applications are very inflexible.
3. It is difficult to find an employer that would be willing to sponsor an employee for H1B, as the process can get expensive and is unreliable.

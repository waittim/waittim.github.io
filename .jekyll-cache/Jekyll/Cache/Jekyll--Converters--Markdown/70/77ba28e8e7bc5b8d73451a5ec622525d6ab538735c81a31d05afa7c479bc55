<p>This makes YouTube a powerful tool for advertising, business, research and content creators.</p>

<p>Being able to predict if a YouTube video is likely to be trending or not is highly useful if you are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A content creator</strong> who wants to make trending videos.</li>
  <li><strong>An advertiser</strong> who wants to know the best videos to put advertisements on before they become trending videos.</li>
  <li><strong>A researcher</strong> trying to derive insight about behavior from YouTube trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, you will need to know :</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>When</strong> to upload/look for, a potentially trending YouTube video</li>
  <li><strong>How</strong> to upload/look for, a potentially trending YouTube video</li>
  <li><strong>What</strong> to upload/look for, in a potentially trending YouTube video</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-look-at-the-trending-videos">A look at the trending videos</h2>

<p>A trending video can be identified by three major measures:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Number of <strong>Likes</strong></li>
  <li>Number of <strong>Views</strong></li>
  <li>Number of <strong>Comments</strong></li>
</ol>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Likes</th>
      <th>Views</th>
      <th>Comments</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MZQhgDcr/image.png" alt="" title="dislikes &amp; likes" /></td>
      <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2ytyqxDt/image.png" alt="" title="views" /></td>
      <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XqtNN7KS/image.png" alt="" title="comments" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Upon looking at the distribution of likes, dislikes , views and comments of the trending YouTube videos, we can see that, ‚Äúmost of‚Äù the trending YouTube videos have a total of:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>1,000,000</strong> views</li>
  <li>About <strong>1,000</strong> dislikes or <strong>10,000</strong> likes</li>
  <li>About <strong>2,000</strong> comments</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be looking at the number of videos being posted and the number of views being received.</p>

<h2 id="best-month">Best month</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W1HBQf7C/image.png" alt="" title="best month" /></p>

<p><strong>Lowest</strong> number of trending videos are being posted in the months of <strong>June</strong> to <strong>October</strong>.</p>

<p>It also shows that the <strong>highest</strong> number of trending videos are posted in the month of <strong>May</strong> with highest number of views.</p>

<p>The best time to post a video would be <strong>April</strong> and <strong>May</strong> as they show the <strong>highest</strong> number of views in comparison to the number of videos posted.  Months December, March and February also see a high number of trending videos being posted but not as many views.</p>

<h2 id="best-day-of-the-week">Best day of the week</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/t436cLyC/image.png" alt="" title="Best day of the week" /></p>

<p>Most trending videos are being posted on <strong>Tuesdays</strong> through <strong>Friday</strong>. Thursday and Friday see the highest number of trending videos with Friday showing the highest number of views.</p>

<p>Interestingly,  <strong>Saturday</strong> and <strong>Sunday</strong> are the worst to post videos as there are fewer videos being posted on these and these days see <strong>lowest number of views</strong> as compared to other days.</p>

<p>However, there might be an extremely small chance that a video that you post on Sunday reaches <strong>200 million views</strong>!</p>

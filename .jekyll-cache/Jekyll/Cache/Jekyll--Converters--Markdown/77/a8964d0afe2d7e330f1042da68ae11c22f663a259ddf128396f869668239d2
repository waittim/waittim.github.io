I"º=<h1 id="h1b">H1B</h1>
<p>The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows companies in the US to hire graduate-level workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A bachelor‚Äôs degree.</li>
  <li>Job offer from a company within the United States for a specialty position that matches your degree.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-is-h1b-popular">Why is H1B Popular?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>For a company in the US, applying for H1B is generally quicker than applying for a US Green Card, so it is popular when they want to bring in an employee for a longer period.</li>
  <li>H1B is open to nationals and citizens of any country, as opposed to other visa types that are only open to people with certain countries of citizenship.</li>
  <li>H1B allows holders to stay for three years initially and can be easily extended to three more years after the first term.</li>
  <li>H1B allows holders to move their status from one company to another and also allows its holders to work part-time and work for multiple employers at the same time.</li>
  <li>The main benefit of H1B that attracts a large volume of applicants is the fact that it is a dual intent visa. This means that it allows its holders to seek permanent residency while under the H1B nonimmigrant status.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>Despite having a lot of advantages, applying for the H1B comes with its own set of caveats or disadvantages.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The biggest drawback of H1B is the fact that there is a limit on the number of petitions that are approved each year. Because of the large number of petitions each year, the USCIS has chosen to have all petitions entered into a lottery. Through this an annual general cap of 65,000 in first, and then run the remaining in the master‚Äôs-and-above 20,000 categories.
This means there is a strong likelihood that for any given year, your petition will not be selected. Once rejected, you will have to wait another year to submit another petition.</li>
  <li>Because of its lottery, the deadlines for the H1B applications are very inflexible.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to find an employer that would be willing to sponsor an employee for H1B, as the process can get expensive and is unreliable.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="number-of-applications-per-state">Number of Applications Per State</h3>

<p>We wanted to look at how the number of applications differed per state over the course of the last 5 years.
Here we can see that the states of California, Texas, New York, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Illinois are the states with the highest number of applications. The number of applicants is seen to increase over time (from 2015 to 2017) for Washington, Virginia and North Carolina. States that have the lowest number of applicants are Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota.</p>

<h1 id="stem">STEM</h1>

<p>Instead of doing an overview of the actual data, we thought it to be better to first filter by STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Management) related jobs. It was expected that the majority of the applications would be coming from STEM, but a confirmation was needed.</p>

<p>The following analysis was done to see the proportion of applicants for H1B that were in STEM fields vs non-STEM fields. This was done using the SOC (Standard Occupational Classification)  code associated with educational background. This was then cross-referenced (left-join) with a list of SOC codes that were considered to be STEM . We combined this with our analysis of the number of applicants per year as a sum just to see if some trends had changed.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x1tpYPZV/image010.png" alt="stem-nonstem" title="Figure 2: Number of applications per year. Proportion of STEM and non-STEM H1B Applicants." /></p>

<p>We observed (from Figure. 2) that the number of applications stays high as compared to the yearly cap of 85,000 applications that get approved. The number of applications also keeps increasing each year with only a slight dip in 2017. The changes in the total number of applications don‚Äôt seem to affect the proportion of STEM to non-STEM applications each year. This is also very interesting to note as the number of non-STEM jobs available in the United States is much higher than the number of STEM jobs.</p>

<p>This disproportionately high number might be attributed to the fact that foreign students with STEM degrees are more likely to pursue STEM fields. The reason for this is that USCIS allows foreign students who pursue a STEM degree during their academic career to stay within the United States for up to three years after they have graduated as opposed to a single year for those of non-STEM backgrounds. This means that during those 3 years, you will have three chances to apply for an H1B and would potentially be eligible to apply for permanent residency.</p>

<p>Another reason why international students might want to pursue STEM would be the prevailing wages for STEM and non-STEM jobs.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/j20Zv3DP/image012.png" alt="" title="Figure 3: Modified box plot to show only the spread and the median of the
wage distribution between STEM and non-STEM." /></p>

<p>The medians of the prevailing wages of the STEM and non-STEM jobs have gotten wider apart but the median for the STEM is always higher than the non-STEM (Figure. 3). In 2018, we see the gap between the two to appear to be the widest.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VN2RLZBp/image014.png" alt="" title="Figure 4: Density plot for the prevailing wages for STEM vs non-STEM jobs." /></p>

<p>It is visible from the density plot of the wage distribution of the year 2018 that the wages of the STEM jobs in 2018 are not only higher but the distribution is also tighter as compared to the distribution for the non-STEM jobs.</p>

<h3 id="top-jobs-in-stem-in-2018">Top Jobs In STEM in 2018</h3>

<p>What naturally followed after this was an analysis of what these STEM jobs were, to gain an understanding of why so many foreign students were attracted to them (Figure 5). Software developer and software engineer positions seem to be the top two jobs with the highest number of applications. This might be attributed to the tech boom of the last 5 years, which has greatly increased the demand for software developers.</p>

<p>Following right after are business analyst and programmer analyst positions. It is important to note that approximately 10 out of these 20 jobs could be associated with data-related jobs. Even if they were not explicitly mentioned as a data-related job, they have, in their job description, data-related roles.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HWw2d2Jv/image016.png" alt="" title="Figure 5: Top 20 jobs in STEM with the highest number of applications in 2018. All jobs are colored blue, data-related jobs are colored red." /></p>

<p>After recognizing the number of data-related jobs within the top 20 job titles in the last year, the next step was to break down what these data-related roles were and if we could combine them and/or break them down based on how complex we wanted our analysis to be.</p>

<h1 id="data-related-jobs-trends">Data Related Jobs Trends</h1>

<p>We created four categories of data-related jobs for this analysis. This categorization was based on the keywords in the job titles.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Job Title</th>
      <th>Associated Keywords</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Business Analyst</td>
      <td>‚ÄúBusiness Intelligence‚Äù</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Analyst</td>
      <td>‚ÄúEDA‚Äù, ‚ÄúVisualization‚Äù,  ‚ÄúData aggregation‚Äù</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Scientist</td>
      <td>‚ÄúMachine learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúModel‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlgorithm‚Äù, ‚ÄúA/B testing‚Äù</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Engineer</td>
      <td>‚ÄúPipeline‚Äù, ‚ÄúData lake‚Äù, ‚ÄúETL‚Äù, ‚ÄúDatabase‚Äù, ‚ÄúWarehouse‚Äù</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We combined machine learning and deep learning jobs into data science jobs, as they are highly correlated and it also made the following visualizations easier to look at. Since these data points were essentially just combined with another category, we need to note that the number of machine learning/deep learning jobs (with those explicit keywords as titles) have remained very few.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/N026V7q4/image020.png" alt="" title="Figure 6: Data related jobs and their four categories. Business Analysts having the highest number of applications and only going down after 2016." /></p>

<p>Two important things to notice here (Figure 6). Firstly, the total number of jobs for business analysts is much higher than the total number of jobs for other roles. There also seems to be a downward trend in the number of jobs for business analysts after 2016; however, the number of jobs within business analytics remains much higher than the number of jobs in any of the other categories in any of the years. Secondly, the number of jobs for data scientists, analysts and engineers are all showing an upward trend. There appears to be a higher number of jobs for data analysts as compared to data scientists and data engineers. A reason for this is that the role of data scientists only emerged recently and the number of jobs available in the industry has just recently, in the past couple of years, started growing.</p>

<h3 id="prevailing-wages-per-data-related-job-category">Prevailing Wages Per Data Related Job Category</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/520q5WsD/image022.png" alt="" title="Figure 7: Prevailing wages for data-related jobs in 2018" /></p>

<p>From the prevailing wages for the different categories that we have established, we see that the median salary (from Figure 7) for a data scientist is a lot higher for the median salary for the business analyst. This coincides with our earlier analysis when we saw that the number of applications for H1B is a lot higher than the number of job applications from a data scientist or analyst role. The higher number of jobs and lower salaries make it a good option for someone within data science to use that as an opportunity to get into the industry.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qvzyhXRT/image024.png" alt="" title="Figure 8: Top 5 companies with the highest number of applications for data-related roles" /></p>

<p>To get a general trend of what was going on in the industry for data-related roles, we look at five companies with the highest number of applications in the years 2014 to 2017 (Fig. 8). We notice here that despite expecting the highest number of applications to come from tech companies, it comes from 3 consulting firms and two tech companies.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y0MQh54n/image026.png" alt="" title="Figure 9: Infosys and the downward trend in job applications" /></p>

<p>The company Infosys showed a very steep downward trend and also had the highest number of H1B applications in the year 2014 which was on a completely different scale as compared to other similar companies (Fig. 9). This drew the attention of our analysis because it was a highly abnormal trend, but upon deeper examination, it revealed a precautionary tale for foreign students trying to get jobs in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="story-behind-infosys">Story Behind Infosys</h3>

<p>In 2013, Infosys agreed to pay $34 million to settle a lawsuit against them which claimed they were involved in fraud and abuse of the immigration process in the United States . Infosys brought foreign nationals into the country on visa types that are not authorized for employment in the United States. This means that the company was involved in fraudulent activity. The USCIS has been stricter on companies like Infosys (Wipro, Tata) because they have a history of trying to go around the system and abusing it to employ cheap labor. The denial rate  for these companies has been extremely high and can be seen to effectively reduce the total number of applications submitted through them over the course of the last 5 years.</p>

<h3 id="top-tech-companies">Top Tech Companies</h3>

<p>A natural assumption for someone entering the market as a data scientist would be that the top tech companies have the highest number of jobs for data-related roles. We examine the top tech giants that are
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HsL7R4by/image028.png" alt="" title="Figure 10: Data related job trends in the top tech companies in the past 5 years" /></p>

<p>There is a general upward trend to the number of data-related jobs for all tech companies, with Google hiring the least number of people within data-related capacities and Amazon hiring the most. While most companies are showing an upward trend, IBM shows a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2017.</p>

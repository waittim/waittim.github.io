<p>The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows companies in the US to hire graduate-level workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A bachelor‚Äôs degree.</li>
  <li>Job offer from a company within the United States for a specialty position that matches your degree.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-is-h1b-popular">Why is H1B Popular?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>For a company in the US, applying for H1B is generally quicker than applying for a US Green Card, so it is popular when they want to bring in an employee for a longer period.</li>
  <li>H1B is open to nationals and citizens of any country, as opposed to other visa types that are only open to people with certain countries of citizenship.</li>
  <li>H1B allows holders to stay for three years initially and can be easily extended to three more years after the first term.</li>
  <li>H1B allows holders to move their status from one company to another and also allows its holders to work part-time and work for multiple employers at the same time.</li>
  <li>The main benefit of H1B that attracts a large volume of applicants is the fact that it is a dual intent visa. This means that it allows its holders to seek permanent residency while under the H1B nonimmigrant status.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>Despite having a lot of advantages, applying for the H1B comes with its own set of caveats or disadvantages.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The biggest drawback of H1B is the fact that there is a limit on the number of petitions that are approved each year. Because of the large number of petitions each year, the USCIS has chosen to have all petitions entered into a lottery. Through this an annual general cap of 65,000 in first, and then run the remaining in the master‚Äôs-and-above 20,000 categories.
This means there is a strong likelihood that for any given year, your petition will not be selected. Once rejected, you will have to wait another year to submit another petition.</li>
  <li>Because of its lottery, the deadlines for the H1B applications are very inflexible.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to find an employer that would be willing to sponsor an employee for H1B, as the process can get expensive and is unreliable.</li>
</ol>

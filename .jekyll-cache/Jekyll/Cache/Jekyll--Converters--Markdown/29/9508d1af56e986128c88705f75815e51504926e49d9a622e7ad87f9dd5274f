<p>3 big parts in Data Science jobs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <strong>EXPLORATION</strong> to turn the unknown into the known.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>INFERENCE</strong> to help find new old.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>PREDICTION</strong> to make better decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="scene-setting">Scene Setting</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine a scenario in which our superior asked us to make suggestions for the launch of a new product, and all we have is a data set that contains the past relevant situation of this type of product.</p>

  <p>What can we do now? What should we do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a common scenario for the industry. Maybe different backgrounds, different fields, but the same purpose: we need to start with pure data and go on to obtain a product that can be implemented.</p>

<p><strong>So what are the key steps in this process?</strong>
Overall, we can divide it into three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>EXPLORATION</li>
  <li>INFERENCE</li>
  <li>PREDICTION</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="01-exploration">01 EXPLORATION</h3>

<p>It is also called <strong>visualization</strong>. Use visual exploration to understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data.</p>

<p>Identify potential relationships or insights that may be hidden in the data which will help <strong>inference</strong> and <strong>prediction</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="02-inference">02 INFERENCE</h3>

<p>Use data analysis to deduce the properties of a dataset. The properties will give the analyst a more accurate perception of the data and provide a theoretical basis for <strong>prediction</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="03-prediction">03 PREDICTION</h3>

<p>Reference <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>inference</strong> results encompass a variety of techniques from data mining, predictive modeling, and machine learning, that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about unknown events.</p>

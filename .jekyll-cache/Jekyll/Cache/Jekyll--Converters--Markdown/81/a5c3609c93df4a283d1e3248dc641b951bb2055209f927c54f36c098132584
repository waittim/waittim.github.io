<p>Being able to predict if a YouTube video is likely to be trending or not is highly useful if you are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A content creator</strong> who wants to make trending videos.</li>
  <li><strong>An advertiser</strong> who wants to know the best videos to put advertisements on before they become trending videos.</li>
  <li><strong>A researcher</strong> trying to derive insight about behavior from YouTube trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, you will need to know :</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>When</strong> to upload/look for, a potentially trending YouTube video</li>
  <li><strong>How</strong> to upload/look for, a potentially trending YouTube video</li>
  <li><strong>What</strong> to upload/look for, in a potentially trending YouTube video</li>

<p>A trending video can be identified by three major measures:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Number of Likes</li>
  <li>Number of Views</li>
  <li>Number of Comments</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>1,000,000 views</li>
  <li>About 1,000 dislikes or 10,000 likes</li>
